# Contributing

The Zenon project operates an open contributor model where anyone is welcome to contribute towards development in the form of peer review, testing and patches. This document explains the practical process and guidelines for contributing.

New contributors are very welcome and needed. This repository falls under the Zenon Code of Conduct.

First, in terms of structure, there is no particular concept of "Zenon developers" in the sense of privileged people. Open source often naturally revolves around a meritocracy where contributors earn trust from the developer community over time. Nevertheless, some hierarchy is necessary for practical purposes. As such, there are repository "maintainers" who are responsible for merging pull requests, as well as a "lead maintainer" who is responsible for the release cycle as well as overall merging, moderation and appointment of maintainers.
